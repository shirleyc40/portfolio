        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a NYC native who loves to learn new skills and meet new people. My passion for Computer Science started with my 
              eagerness to learn more about HTML/CSS. I love the feeling of building something step by step and working through all the obstacles in the way. With technology I hope to be able to help the society and give back. I hope to find a position 
              where I am continuously challenged and can collaborate with different teams to bring impact into the society. Outside of work, I love to travel and bake!

                    I worked in a group of 3, where I was mainly in charge of the solver and generator. We used python and a python library called py-constraint. To generate different levels, we used a prefilled base board and shuffled the rows, columns and sub-group. We then removed cells from highest density to lowest.

                    I was on the development team, focusing on building the app using React Native and firebase. I collaborated with other student developers, as well as our designers. We worked in an agile environment, with weekly standups and check ins. I was able to develop my communication skills and gain confidence in asking for help.

                    I designed most of the interface, getting feedback from my peers. I used React Native to create this app. Through this, I was able to develop my time managment and project planning skills. It was my first time using React Native, which made it more rewarding and valuable. It was enjoyable to feel passionate about the work I was doing.

                    This was an individual project that involved finding a people problem through user interviews and coming up with solutions through brainstorming sessions. The problem I was solving was how people found it difficult to manage notifications from different slack groups and channels.I really enjoyed this class/project because it taught me a different side of things; how designs are created, the different effects of placements of a component.
